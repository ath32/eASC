# eASCs

This repository contains the source code for running the analysis described in the paper. Not all of the scripts in this repository will be relevant to the complete replication of the study - if you wish to do this, please send me an e-mail and we can sort something out (a.t.ho@bath.ac.uk).

Some notes:

- We provide a list of all species names used 
- All python scripts can be found in '0_Cleaned_Python_Scripts'.
- The PGLS analysis was conducted using R, hence relevant scripts can be found in '0_Cleaned_R_Scripts'.
- The input files for the PGLS analyses may be found in the 'Trees' and 'Variables' folders.
- All data relevant to Ne calculation / existing Ne estimates can be found in the 'Ne' folder.
- All data used in the intraspecies comparisons (D. discoideum, A. thaliana, Aspergillus sps.) can be found in 'Intraspecies comparisons'.
